    <p>In Hawaii i went all over that place, i loved swimming in the ocean, in fact that I swam in the ocean at least once every day (That's how much I loved it) I also went scuba diving a lot it was really dfun to learn about all the cool exotic fish they have there, well compared to Canada anyway. we went on some sort of adventure every day while we were there. I went with my friends Julia, Heather, and Megan. We had a great time and really enjoyed it and can't wait to come back for a longer time and a great and fun tuime again.
    <h3> Switzerland</h3>
